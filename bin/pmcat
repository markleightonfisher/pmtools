=head1 NAME

pmcat - page through a module file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Given a module name, figure out the path name and send
that to the user's pager.

    $ pmcat CGI

This works also on alternate installed versions of Perl:

    $ oldperl -S pmcat strict

    $ filsperl -S pmcat Threads

This command is mostly here for people too lazy to type

    $ more `pmpath CGI`
