=head1 NAME

plxload - show what files a perl program loads at compile time

=head1 SYNOPSYS

    $ plxload

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is used to show what modules a program would load at
compile time via C<use>.  Because this installs an at-exit handler and
then uses Perl's B<-c> flag for compile only, it will not find modules
loaded at run-time.  Use the Devel::Loaded module for that.
