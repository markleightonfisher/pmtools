=head1 NAME

basepods - print out pod paths for the standard perl manpages 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program uses your configuration's C<installprivlib> directory
to look up the full paths to those pod pages.  Any files in that
directory whose names end in C<.pod> will be printed to the standard
output, one per line.  This is normally used in backticks to produce
a list of filenames for other commands.

=head1 EXAMPLES

    $ podgrep typeglob `basepods`

    $ basepods | grep delt
    /usr/local/devperl/lib/5.00554/pod/perl5004delta.pod
    /usr/local/devperl/lib/5.00554/pod/perl5005delta.pod
    /usr/local/devperl/lib/5.00554/pod/perldelta.pod

You can also run this using alternate perl binaries, like so:

    $ oldperl -S basepods | grep delt
    /usr/lib/perl5/pod/perldelta.pod

    $ podgrep -i thread `filsperl basepods | grep delt`
    ....
