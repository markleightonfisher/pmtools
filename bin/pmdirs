=head1 NAME

pmdirs - print out module directories

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This just prints out the current @INC path, one directory per line.
This is for people who don't want to parse through C<perl -V> output or
hack up their own calls to C<perl -e>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

    $ pmdirs
    /home/tchrist/perllib/i686-linux
    /home/tchrist/perllib
    /usr/local/devperl/lib/5.00554/i686-linux
    /usr/local/devperl/lib/5.00554
    /usr/local/devperl/lib/site_perl/5.00554/i686-linux
    /usr/local/devperl/lib/site_perl/5.00554
    .

This also works for alternate version of Perl:

    $ filsperl -S pmdirs
    /home/tchrist/perllib
    /usr/local/filsperl/lib/5.00554/i686-linux-thread
    /usr/local/filsperl/lib/5.00554
    /usr/local/filsperl/lib/site_perl/5.00554/i686-linux-thread
    /usr/local/filsperl/lib/site_perl/5.00554
    .
