=head1 NAME

faqpods - print out pod paths for the standard perl faqs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program uses your configuration's C<installprivlib> directory
to look up the full paths to those pod pages.  Any files in that
directory whose names start in C<perlfaq> will be printed to the standard
output, one per line.  This is normally used in backticks to produce
a list of filenames for other commands.

=head1 EXAMPLES

    $ podgrep typeglob `faqpods`
    ....

You can also run this using alternate perl binaries, like so:

    $ podgrep -i thread `filsperl faqpods`
    ....
